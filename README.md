## Conclusion


To raise drivers awereness, **New York City** should consider introducing **courses or trainings programs for residents** as lack of attention is a leadingy contributing factor in traffic accidents.

Moreover, **Queens** stands out when it comes to **incidents** caused by **unsafe speed**. The City should improve infrastructure in the borough by installing more **speed bumps** and **increasing speed enforcement** to help prevent further deaths and injuries.

Finally, residents should **exercise extra caution**, when driving through **Brooklyn** and **Queens**, as these are **the most dangerous boroughs** in terms of accident frequency and death rate.
